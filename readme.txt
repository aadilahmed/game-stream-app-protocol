So far, I've written the client and server implementations, but haven't 
completed the main quic engine implementation.

Only one account is available to login with, with username 'user',
and password 'password'.

When the application is finished, the instructions to run it will be:
1. First run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the requirements
2. Run the command 'python server.py', then 'python client.py' to start
the application.
